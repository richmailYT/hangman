## Golang Hangman

I created Hangman as a simple project where I could learn Golang's syntax.
Although I am still confused on pointers and whatever "*" is, I've learned how to 
- declare variables
- create and call functions
- use if-statements
- for-loops
- how to import and use packages


To play Hangman, simply download the latest version of Golang from https://go.dev/
Then, in the terminal or command prompt, run `go build`. This will produce an executable for your system, which you can then run with `hangman.exe` on Windows and `./hangman` on MacOs and Linux
If it doesn't run on MacOs or Linux, run the command `sudo chmod +x ./hangman` before attempting to run it again with `./hangman`
